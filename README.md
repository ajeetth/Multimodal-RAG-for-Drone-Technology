# Multimodal-RAG-for-Drone-Technology

building a RAG system that can process and understand both text and image data to answer questions about drone technology.

The program implements:
Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and understand text about drones.
Multimodal datasets containing images and labels of drones.
Functions to display images and identify objects within them using bounding boxes.
Builds a system that can answer questions about drone technology using both text and images.
